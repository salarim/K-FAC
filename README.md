# K-FAC

Implementing a K-FAC (Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature) optimizer for deep learning models. It incorporates features like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for improved stability when training on multiple sequential tasks, as well as Taylor expansions for weight updates. The project is built with PyTorch and designed for multi-task learning on datasets like permuted MNIST (pMNIST).
